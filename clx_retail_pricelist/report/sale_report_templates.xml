                party arising under the laws of the United States. However, Provider shall have no obligations under
                this Section 9.1 with respect to intellectual property rights claims to the extent arising out of: (a) any
                instruction, information, designs, specifications, or other materials provided by Customer in writing
                to Provider; (b) use of the Deliverables in combination with any materials not supplied to Customer or
                specified by Provider in writing, if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Deliverables
                not so combined; or (c) any modifications or changes made to the Deliverables by or on behalf of any person other
                than Provider or its personnel.

<B>9.2. Customer's Indemnification. </B>Customer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Provider and
                its officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns from and against all Losses arising
                out of or resulting from: (a) bodily injury, death of any person, or damage to real or tangible, personal property
                resulting from the grossly negligent or willful acts or omissions of Customer; and (b) Customer's material
                breach of any representation, warranty, or obligation of Customer in this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
<B>9.3. Indemnification Procedure.</B> The party seeking indemnification hereunder shall promptly notify the
                indemnifying party in writing of any claim and cooperate with the indemnifying party at the indemnifying
                party's sole cost and expense. The indemnifying party shall immediately take control of the defense and
                investigation of such claim and shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at the
                indemnifying party's sole cost and expense. The indemnifying party shall not settle any action in a manner
                that adversely affects the rights of the indemnified party without the indemnified party's prior written
                consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The indemnified party may participate in and observe
                the proceedings at its own cost and expense.

<B>9.4. Obligation Exceptions. </B>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the indemnifying
                party is not obligated to indemnify, hold harmless, or defend the indemnified party against any claim (whether
                direct or indirect) to the extent such claim or corresponding losses arise out of or result from, in whole or in
                part, the indemnified party's: (a) negligence or more culpable act or omission (including recklessness or
                willful misconduct); or (b) bad faith failure to materially comply with any of its obligations set forth in
                this Agreement.

</p>
<p>
<B>10.1. Dollar Cap. </B>Except for the specific remedies expressly identified as such in this Agreement,

                damages shall in no event in the aggregate exceed the Fees and Expenses received by Provider hereunder with respect
                to the work involved under the applicable Insertion Order. Customer's exclusive remedy for any claim arising
                out of these arrangements shall be for Provider, upon receipt of written notice pursuant to Section 14.7, to use
                commercially reasonable efforts to cure the breach at its expense, or failing that, the return of Fees and Expenses
                paid to Provider for the work related to the breach.

                INTERRUPTION, LOST BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, OR LOST SAVINGS), EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBLE
                EXISTENCE. THE LIABILITIES LIMITED BY THIS SECTION 10 APPLY: (A) TO LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE; (B) REGARDLESS OF THE
                FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE; (C) EVEN IF A PARTY IS ADVISED IN
                ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES IN QUESTION AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE; AND (D) EVEN IF A
                PARTY'S REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

<p>
<B>11.3. Termination for Bankruptcy, Insolvency, or Financial Insecurity.</B> Either Party may terminate this
                Agreement immediately at its option upon written notice if the other Party: (a) becomes or is declared insolvent or

<SPAN
                    >The Parties agree that, in the event of a dispute or alleged breach, they will work together in good faith
                    first, to resolve the matter internally by escalating it to higher levels of management and, then if necessary,
                    to use a mutually agreed upon alternative dispute resolution technique prior to resorting to litigation. Any
                    mediation or arbitration under this Section </SPAN
                >12<SPAN>
                    will be held in Seattle, Washington. In the event the parties fail to mutually agree upon such technique within
                    thirty (30) days after good faith attempts at internal resolution have failed, either party may resort to
                    litigation. This provision shall not apply to disputes involving confidentiality or infringement of intellectual
                    property rights (in which case either party shall be free to seek any available remedies).</SPAN

<B>14. MISCELLANEOUS.</B>
</p>
<p>
<B>14.1. Severability.</B> If a court holds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or
                unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect and the Parties will amend the
                Agreement to give effect to the stricken clause to the maximum extent possible.
</p>
<p>
<B>14.2. Relationship of the Parties. </B>The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors.
                Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture, or other
                form of joint enterprise, employment, or fiduciary relationship between the Parties, and neither party shall have
                authority to contract for or bind the other Party in any manner whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
<B>14.3. Assignment.</B> Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any Insertion Order without the written consent
                of the other. Any attempt by a Party to this Agreement to assign this Agreement or any Insertion Order without the
                written consent of the other Party may be deemed notice of termination of this Agreement, effective on the date of
                assignment, by the other Party.
</p>
<p>
<B>14.4. Waiver. </B>A Party does not waive any right under this Agreement by failing to insist on compliance with
                any of the terms of this Agreement or by failing to exercise any right hereunder. Any waivers granted hereunder are
                effective only if recorded in a writing signed by the Party granting such waiver.

<p>
<B>14.5. Force Majeure. </B>The Provider shall not be liable or responsible to Customer, nor be deemed to have
                defaulted or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this
                Agreement when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond the
                reasonable control of Provider including, without limitation, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion,
                governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts,
                riot, or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, lock-outs, strikes or other
                labor disputes (whether or not relating to either party's workforce), or restraints or delays affecting carriers or
                inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, materials or telecommunication breakdown
                or power outage, provided that, if the event in question continues for a continuous period in excess of 90 days,
                Customer shall be entitled to give notice in writing to Provider to terminate this Agreement.

                rules, except to the extent that such law is preempted by applicable federal law. The Parties hereby irrevocably
                submit to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the federal and state courts in King County, Washington, for
                any dispute arising out of this Agreement, waive all objections to jurisdiction and venue of such courts, and agree
                not to commence or prosecute any such dispute other than in such courts.

<B>Notice</B>
</I
                >”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the Insertion Order(s) (or
                to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this

                        other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. No modification or amendment of this Agreement is

                        represents and warrants that he or she has the authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of the Party and
